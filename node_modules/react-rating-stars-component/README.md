## DEMO: https://codesandbox.io/s/elegant-mountain-w3ngk?file=/src/App.js

### Get started quickly

###### Install react-stars package with NPM:

`npm install react-rating-stars-component --save`

Then in your project include the component:

```javascript
import ReactStars from "react-rating-stars-component";
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

const ratingChanged = (newRating) => {
  console.log(newRating);
};

render(
  <ReactStars
    count={5}
    onChange={ratingChanged}
    size={24}
    activeColor="#ffd700"
  />,

  document.getElementById("where-to-render")
);
```

Or use other elements as icons:

> We do not support CSS for other third party libraries like fontawesome in this case. So you must import it by urself.

```javascript
import ReactStars from "react-rating-stars-component";
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

const ratingChanged = (newRating) => {
  console.log(newRating);
};

render(
  <ReactStars
    count={5}
    onChange={ratingChanged}
    size={24}
    isHalf={true}
    emptyIcon={<i className="far fa-star"></i>}
    halfIcon={<i className="fa fa-star-half-alt"></i>}
    fullIcon={<i className="fa fa-star"></i>}
    activeColor="#ffd700"
  />,

  document.getElementById("where-to-render")
);
```

### Help improve the component

###### Build on your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:ertanhasani/react-stars.git
# Go into project folder
cd react-stars
# Install dependancies
npm install
```

Build the component:

```bash
npm build
```

Run the examples (dev):

```bash
npm run dev-example
```

Build the examples (production):

```bash
npm run build-example
```

Then in your browser go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/example](http://127.0.0.1:8080/example)

### Requirements

You will need to have React in your project in order to use the component, I didn't bundle React in the build, because it seemed like a crazy idea.

### Todo

- Make better docs
- Better state management
- Write tests
